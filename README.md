# APRO
### Java Affinity Propagation Library // Parallelized
v1.0.6
http://www.apro.u-psud.fr


Apro is a Java implementation of Affinity Propagation clustering algorithm. It is parallelized for easy and efficient use on multicore processors and NUMA architectures (using libnuma native library). Besides the basic (parallelized) algorithm, it also implements Hierarchical Affinity Propagation (HiAP), making it usable in practice even on huge datasets. Apro comes with a couple of ready to use datasource providers (for Delimiter Separated Values, MATLAB files, etc.).
